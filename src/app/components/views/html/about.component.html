		<p><strong>What is LittleWeeb?</strong></p>
		<p>The goal of LittleWeeb is to give users the best of both worlds: High quality anime & streaming without advertisments and other crap.</p>
		<p><strong>What is XDCC?</strong></p>
		<p>XDCC is a file sharing protocol build upon the DCC protocol running over IRC (Internet Relay Chat). It basically allows files to be shared using a central server acting as a bot on a chat channel, you can message the bot with an indicator for which file you want to download.</p>
		<p>XDCC used to be popular in the day where IRC was used often to chat with each other, up till 2005. Then other chat services such as MSN and Skype took over. WIthout the file sharing part. But fortunately, the anime scene kept using XDCC, and due to the limited users, there is plenty of bandwith available! (Depending on the bot you choose to download from).</p>
		<p><strong>What are the advantages of XDCC over other file sharing methods?</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>XDCC uses TCP instead of UDP (P2P/torrent)</li>
			<li>TCP = serial download, you can start playing the file right after the download starts!</li>
			<li>Single server that provides the file</li>
			<li>You are not uploading</li>
			<li>Stable download speed</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>What are the disadvantages of XDCC over other file sharing methods?</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>XDCC depends on a single file host.</li>
			<li>Host regulates speed.</li>
			<li>Host regulates availability.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>How does LittleWeeb get it&#39;s information?</strong></p>
		<p>LittleWeeb uses the API&#39;s from the following sources:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://nibl.co.uk/"> NIBL - A XDCC indexer site for Anime</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/jenga201/niblapi">NIBL API - By Jenga201 - Github</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://kitsu.io"> Kitsu.io - A anime information site.</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://kitsu.docs.apiary.io/"> Kitsu API Docs</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Is LittleWeeb open source?</strong></p>
		<p>Yup, ofcourse it is! Best way to be trusted is by opensourcing right? It&#39;s licensed using the MIT license, so technically speaking, you can do whatever you want with it!</p>
		<p>Here you can find the source code AND the latest versions: https://github.com/littleweeb/LittleWeeb</p>
		<p><strong>How does LittleWeeb work?</strong></p>
		<p>LittleWeeb automatically connects you to a irc server (irc.rizon.net) and channel(s): #nibl,#horriblesubs,#littleweeb</p>
		<p>It generates a username for you, so you don&#39;t have to do these little steps anymore. It gets the latest released episodes from NIBL in combination with the API from Kitsu and when you search for an anime, it uses the api from Kitsu (basically a MyAnimeList api, but done better). 
		<p>When you click on a cover of a anime, it will load all the information using the api from Kitsu. It then tries to find every episode for that Anime using the API from Nibl. You will get a list with episodes, where you can choose if you want to use the advanced mode or easy mode. The easy simply automates everything. It will select the best source and by default (if it's available) 720p episode. You can however specify a different resolution. The advanced mode allows you to manually select a source and file to your liking. With both modes you can either hit Download or Play. When you click on Play, it will automatically start the download and launch your default media player with your selected episode. If you hit Download, it will start downloading the episode. If the download has started, you can still choose to play the episode along with other actions: abort & open file location. Every anime get's it's own directory.  </p>	
		<p>LittleWeeb has multiple version that you can use: A server for using on your NAS (or other non-windows operating systems), a stand-alone Windows Application and a Android App.</p>
		<p>The interface is written in Angular 5 using TypeScript (it&#39;s awesome :D) and semanticui as css framework.</p>
		<p>The backend is written in C#.</p>

		<p class="custom-text3-about">There is substantial debate, and a number of disputes brewing, about whether linking to sites that allegedly engage in copyright infringing activities results in contributory or vicarious liability for the linking site. While the&nbsp;<b><a href="https://ilt.eff.org/index.php/Copyright:_Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act" style="text-decoration-line: none; color: rgb(11, 0, 128); background: none;" title="Copyright: Digital Millennium Copyright Act">Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)</a></b>&nbsp;provides some protection for &ldquo;information location tools&rdquo; that link to infringing content, the law remains unsettled.</p>

			<li class="li-custom1-about"><i>Ticketmaster Corp. v. Microsoft Corp.</i>, No. 97-3055 DDP (C.D. Cal. Apr. 29, 1997). Microsoft operated a site called Sidewalk Seattle, which provided information about upcoming entertainment in the Seattle area. Among other things, it linked to the order form page at Ticketmaster&rsquo;s site in order to allow its users to easily order tickets to events described on the Seattle Sidewalk site. Ticketmaster argued that such deep linking unfairly avoided advertising and marketing on its site. Ticketmaster sued Microsoft alleging trademark dilution, false representation of affiliation under the Lanham Act, and false advertising and unfair competition under California law. Microsoft then filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration that linking is per se legal. The case was settled in February 1999. Microsoft agreed not to deep link from its Sidewalk city guides to pages within the Ticketmaster site and instead to point visitors to Ticketmaster&rsquo;s home page.</li>
			<li class="li-custom1-about"><i>Shetland Times Ltd. v. Wills, et al.</i>, 1997 F.S.R. 604 (Ct. Sess. O.H.) (Ireland Oct. 24, 1996). The Shetland Times newspaper sought an injunction to prevent the Shetland News, a rival news website, from linking to Shetland Times websites, copying the text of the Times&rsquo; headlines and linking to the Times&rsquo; articles in such a way that readers might mistake them for the work of the News. The Times maintained that the News&rsquo; use of the Times&rsquo; site constituted copyright infringement and unfair competition. The court stated in an interlocutory decision that headlines could constitute literary works justifying copyright protection. The News maintained that creating links without permission is the essence of how the Web operates, and an injunction would &ldquo;block free access to the Internet.&rdquo; The case settled in November 1997. The Shetland News was granted permission to link to the Times&rsquo; headlines, so long as the links were labeled &ldquo;A Shetland Times Story&rdquo; and included a button linking to the Times.</li>

			<li class="li-custom1-about"><i>Intellectual Reserve, Inc. v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry</i>, 75 F. Supp. 2d 1290 (D. Utah 1999). Holders of a copyright in the Church Handbook of Instruction sued defendant for contributory infringement for linking to infringing copies of the work (after defendant was enjoined from itself posting the infringing copies). On unusual facts, the court found that defendants could be held liable for contributory infringement since they actively directed users to the infringing sites. Due to the unusual facts, this case has not been widely followed.</li>

These facts indicate a sufficient involvement by Funeral Depot that could allow a reasonable jury to hold Funeral Depot liable for copyright infringement or contributory infringement, if infringement it is. The possibility of copyright infringement liability on these unusual facts showing such extensive involvement in the allegedly infringing display should not pose any broad threat to the use of hyperlinks on the internet.&quot;)</li>
